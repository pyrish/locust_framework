# Performance Testing Framework using Locust.io

I'm in the process of creating a flexible and scalable performance testing framework with the capability to store the results into InfluxDB and then visualize all reports on a Grafana Dashboard. I will be capable of running from Docker container as well and with the option to scale if run on AWS EKS (Container Orchestration)

Todo list:
- Add Logger
- Add Event Handlers
- Integrate with InfluxDB
- Integrate with Grafana
